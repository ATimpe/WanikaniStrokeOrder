# WaniKani Stroke Order

This is a local web application made to help with giving additional quizes for WaniKani users for writing kanji. At the moment, WaniKani has no services that assist in writing the kanji taught there. This app's goal is to provide writing tutorials and quizes alongside WaniKani using WaniKani's API
