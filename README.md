# WaniKani Stroke Order

This is a local web application made to help with giving additional quizes for WaniKani users for writing kanji. At the moment, WaniKani has no services that assist in writing the kanji taught there. This app's goal is to provide writing tutorials and quizes alongside WaniKani using WaniKani's API

# Instalation

This app requires Node.JS which can be downloaded here: https://nodejs.org

Download the lastest version of the app. Run the `start.bat` script or type `npm start` into your console while in the directory.

# Curent State

The app is, at the moment, in a very bare bones state. You can currently only link your WaniKani API key and see animated stroke order diagrams for the different kanji.

# Planned Features
- Static stroke order diagrams
- Quizes based on WaniKani level or custom made queues
- Clean and readable webpage design
- SRS based learning system
- Alternate kanji writings
- Information on individual kanji writings
